Compiler Design Project
A simple yet educational compiler developed using Lex (Flex) and Yacc (Bison) to demonstrate the fundamental phases of a compiler pipeline. This project was created as part of an undergraduate Compiler Design course to illustrate core concepts including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, parse tree construction, and intermediate code generation.

Key Features
Lexical analysis using Lex/Flex

Syntax parsing with Yacc/Bison

Custom grammar for a minimal programming language (subset of C)

Parse tree generation and basic intermediate code output (e.g., three-address code)

Basic error handling and reporting

Command-line interface for compiling source files

Compiler Architecture
Lexical Analyzer (lex.l)

Breaks input source code into tokens: identifiers, keywords, literals, operators, etc.

Syntax Analyzer (parser.y)

Implements context-free grammar rules

Parses token streams and constructs a parse tree

Semantic Analysis (Optional)

Performs simple type checking and symbol validation

Intermediate Code Generation

Generates an intermediate representation (IR), such as 3-address code

(Optional) Optimization & Code Generation

Additional phases can be implemented for optimization or target code generation

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure the following tools are installed:

Flex

Bison

GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)

Build Instructions
bash
Copy code
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shaileshjukaria/CompilerDesign.git
cd CompilerDesign

# Run Flex and Bison to generate C source files
flex lex.l
bison -d parser.y

# Compile the generated files with GCC
gcc lex.yy.c parser.tab.c -o compiler

# Execute the compiler with a source code input
./compiler < input.txt
Project Structure
bash
